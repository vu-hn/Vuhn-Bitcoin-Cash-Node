Vuhn Bitcoin Cash Node
======================

Vuhn Bitcoin Cash Node (VBCHN) is a fork of [Bitcoin Cash Node](https://www.bitcoincashnode.org),
a full node implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol. It is a descendant of
the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and [Bitcoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org)
software projects.

What is Bitcoin Cash?
---------------------

Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone,
anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no
central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out
collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became
a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two
split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin
share the same transaction history up until the split.
